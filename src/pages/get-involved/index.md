title: How can you help?
---
We know in situations this huge, complicated and emotional it’s easy to feel hopeless and helpless, but this could not be less true. The smallest act of kindness can go so far and may be the difference between a person surviving this difficult time in their life or becoming another devastating headline.

#### To help, you can give any of these 3 things:

# *1. YOUR TIME*

## Volunteer:

O﻿ur projects in Pakistan, Guatemala and Italy are currently taking volunteer applications. Contact us via [insta ](https://www.instagram.com/mardi.france2019/)to apply. 

Our partners [Medical Volunteers International](https://medical-volunteers.org/get-involved/) also run refugee healthcare clinics across Europe:

#### Balkan Route (Serbia + Bosnia)

Where currently many refugees are making the dangerous journey on foot to Western Europe from Greece following rejected asylum claims and maltreatment.

#### Greece (Mainland + Islands)

Where thousands of refugees are trapped waiting for asylum decisions whether they want to stay in Greece or not having just reached Europe via Turkey.
