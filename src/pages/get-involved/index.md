title: How can you help?
---
We know in situations this complicated, emotional and large-scale itâ€™s easy to feel hopeless and helpless but this could not be less true. The smallest act of kindness can go so far and may be the difference between a refugee surviving this difficult time in their life or becoming another tragic headline.

#### To help, you can give any of these 3 things:

# *1. YOUR TIME*

## Volunteer:

#### Medics

* all staff groups needed including nurses, paramedics, doctors, physiotherapists and mental health professionals
* students welcome but will be supervised by qualified staff (will provide assistance to the team only)

#### Translators

* Pashto, Farsi, Dari, Arabic, Tigrinya, Amharic, Oroma, Somali, German, Italian, English, French

#### Clinic coordinators

* must be confident working with a crowd and language/cultural barriers
* must be happy to help out with whatever tasks arise (helping medical teams with dressings, pharmacy runs, phone calls/advocacy, etc.)
