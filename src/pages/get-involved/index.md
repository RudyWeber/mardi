title: How can you help?
---
We know in situations this huge, complicated and emotional itâ€™s easy to feel hopeless and helpless, but this could not be less true. The smallest act of kindness can go so far and may be the difference between a refugee surviving this difficult time in their life or becoming another devastating headline.

#### To help, you can give any of these 3 things:

# *1. YOUR TIME*

## Volunteer:

#### Medical Refugee Support NGOs

Our partners [Medical Volunteers International](https://medical-volunteers.org/get-involved/) run refugee healthcare clinics across Europe:

###### Balkan Route (Serbia + Bosnia)

Where currently many refugees are making the dangerous journey on foot to Western Europe from Greece following rejected asylum claims and maltreatment.

###### Greece (Mainland + Islands)

Where thousands of refugees are trapped waiting for asylum decisions whether they want to stay in Greece or not having just reached Europe via Turkey.

# *2. DONATIONS*

Our funds are currently on divert to [For Refugees](https://www.forrefugees.org/) who support most grassroots refugee support groups across Europe:
