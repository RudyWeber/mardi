title: About MARDi
---
MARDi was formally created in January 2019 by Harriet Crook, a Emergency Medicine Doctor in the UK, and Elena Lydon, an experienced Emergency Department Nurse in Ireland, joined shortly after by Harriet Payne, an Intensive Care Nurse in the UK. Prior to this we had mostly worked in Calais and Paris and found a gap in the healthcare provision for refugees in the Paris Refugee Camps. At this point, supported by friends who we regularly worked with supporting refugees stranded in camps across Europe, we decided to organise.

The Paris Refugee Crisis, as part of the wider European Refugee Crisis, is a deliberate, racist and unforgivable abuse of human rights. As Europeans, we cannot sit by and watch the persecution of refugees in our name. We cannot wait for politicians, the media, and popular opinion to change, we must act now by standing in solidarity with our sisters and brothers, refugees. MARDi aims to do just that by not only providing essential frontline care but also by showing refugees in person that there is a strong, compassionate side to Europe that welcomes refugees, hears their struggle, accepts responsibility, and will fight for them.

Today, MARDi has grown into an international collective of over 1000 members run by a small team from across Europe and North America. We are registered in France (SIREN no. 892120353).
