title: About MARDi
---
MARDi was formally created in January 2019 by a group of nurses and doctors from Ireland and the UK after working together providing healthcare support to homeless refugees across France since 2017. Prior to this we had mostly worked in Calais and Paris and found a gap in the healthcare provision for refugees in the Paris Refugee Camps. At this point, supported by colleagues from camps across Europe, we decided to organise. 

Today, MARDi has grown into an international collective of over 1500 members run by a small team from across Europe. We are a registered NGO in France (SIREN no. 892120353). Our projects now run globally with current focus in Pakistan, Italy, Greece, Guatemala and France. 

Our Core Team:

* Harriet Payne: Volunteer Coordinator, *Nurse*
* Harriet Crook: Project Coordinator, *Doctor*
* Katy Last: Fundraising and Financial Coordinator, *Nurse*
* Cati Mayer: Logistics Coordinator, *IT Engineer*

We believe every human being is equal.
