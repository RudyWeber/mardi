At last count, there are now over 2000 people living in the Paris Refugee Camps.

Who do you protect?

Food is sparse, everyone is hungry. As another lockdown hits France and islamophobia sweeps across the nation spread from the mouths of politicians people are scared. And rightly so.

Our team is on the ground 5 days a week working alongside [Medecins du Monde](https://www.medecinsdumonde.org/) and [Samusocial de Paris](https://www.samusocial.paris/) to provide frontline medical care, but it's not enough.

If you can help with food distributions please contact [Solidarité Migrants Wilson](https://www.facebook.com/Solidarit%C3%A9-migrants-Wilson-598228360377940).

Solidarité with our sisters and brothers, this too shall pass.
