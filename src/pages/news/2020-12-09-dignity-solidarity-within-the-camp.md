##### PARIS REFUGEE CAMPS: MARDI SITUATION UPDATE 18.10.2020 – WEEKLY GROUND TEAM REPORT

\
Our medical team works hard to provide privacy, fairness and high-quality care for all, as much as can be achieved in an open camp like this. However sometimes people are too sick (physically or mentally) to join the line. In these cases our team reaches out to see people in their tents, relying on other people from the camp to help us find and treat these extra vulnerable patients. A young man with severe mental health problems was highlighted to our medical team this week by another camp resident. One of our experienced nurses was able to review him and help him access the mental health support he needed. 

We are constantly blown away by the efforts refugees, who are sometimes total strangers, who may not even speak the same language, will go to help each other.

Refugees always were and always will be the best of us.
