title: How can you help?

We know in situations this complicated, heart-breaking, and vast itâ€™s easy to feel hopeless and also useless but this could not be less true. The smallest act of kindness can go so far and may be the difference between a refugee surviving this difficult time in their life or becoming another tragic headline.

To help, you can give any of these 3 things:

# *1. YOUR TIME*

#### Medical volunteers

* all staff groups needed including for example physiotherapists and mental health professionals
* students welcome but must be supervised by qualified staff (will provide assistance to the team only)

#### Translators

* Pashto, Farsi, Dari, Arabic, Tigrinya, Amharic, Oroma, Somali, German, Italian, English, French

#### Clinic coordinators

* must be confident working with a crowd and language/cultural barriers
* must be happy to help out with whatever tasks arise (helping medical teams with dressings, pharmacy runs, phone calls/advocacy, etc.)

#### How to sign up

* **Email [info@MARDi.org.uk](mailto:info@MARDi.org.uk)** - you can also join the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/639221036512761/) for volunteer opportunity updates
* Our new **MARDi@Home** project offers general support to refugees in the UK in whatever way needed, for example:

  * Signing up with a GP, accessing legal help and social services, i.e. foodbanks, job centres
  * Understanding official letters, emails, etc
  * Email [home@MARDi.org.uk](mailto:home@MARDi.org.uk) to get involved in your area

# *2. DONATIONS*

#### Financial and medical supplies
