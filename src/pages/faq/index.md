## What is MARDi?

MARDi is a grassroots not-for-profit organisation set up by volunteer medical professionals from the UK. We are under the umbrella of Donate4Refugees charity number 1168435. It is an international network of medical professionals who provide voluntary medical aid to refugees and displaced people living in refugee camps in Paris, France. MARDi volunteers provide first aid, basic medical care and triage in the camps and hospital referrals and advocacy for issues requiring secondary care. 

## Where do you operate? 

We operate in the northern suburbs of Paris, in Porte d'Aubervilliers and Porte de la Chapelle. What sort of volunteers do you need? 

We need doctors, adult, paediatric and mental health nurses, paramedics, midwives, physiotherapists and dentists. Volunteers must be fully licensed in their home country. We can sometimes accept final year students. Arabic, Pashto, Dari, Farsi and French speakers are helpful. As well as a relevant qualification and clinical experience, all volunteers need to be physically fit enough to cope with a day of walking and carrying heavy bags. Volunteers must feel confident and competent to triage and treat a variety of conditions and wounds (see below) and know when to refer for secondary care. 

## What is a typical day like for MARDi volunteers?

Volunteers arrive at our warehouse at 9 am. There is a briefing and medical supplies are prepared for the day ahead. The camps are reached on foot, by bus or tram and volunteers perform paramedic style assessments and treat where possible, or refer to other services where appropriate. After a lunch break, work continues until approximately 5 pm, though finishing times may vary. More than one camp may be visited in a day. Most of the day is spent outside, regardless of weather conditions. 

## Is there a minimum time commitment for medical volunteers?

We suggest a minimum commitment of 3 days. 

## Can MARDi fund my travel and accommodation?

No. At this time we rely on volunteers funding their own travel and accommodation, and to fundraise to cover the cost of medicines and other supplies we require. We expect all volunteers to bring a good quantity of supplies with them. See the current needs list for what is required. 

## Does MARDi provide medical indemnity insurance?

No. Volunteers need to organise their own medical indemnity insurance, enquiring with their usual provider in the first instance. What else can I help with? We are always in need of medical and other supplies – please see the current needs list. You can share our social media stories and encourage donations via our PayPal account. Also you can tell your friends and colleagues about us! 

## Where can I stay in Paris?

We advise volunteers to stay in or near the St Denis area as this is near our warehouse. There are many AirBnBs in the area.

## What do I need to bring with me when I visit the camps?

Volunteers need to bring work ID, Metro tickets or card, scrub tops, walking boots, jeans and clothing suitable for the weather conditions. Most of the day is spent outside so thermals, waterproofs, hat, suncream as appropriate and water bottle and snacks make for a more comfortable working day. It is a good idea to leave all but essential items at home, keep valuables in zipped pockets and consider that anything brought along will need to be carried for the whole day.
