  title: COVID-19 update (October 2020)
  description: "MARDi is still providing frontline medical care to refugees living
    in the Paris Refugee Camps and we need volunteers to join our team, both
    medical and non-medical. International travel restrictions and regulations
    are constantly changing meaning like most grassroots refugee aid
    organisations we are struggling to maintain a full team of volunteers,
    therefore we need your help more than ever and especially for longer-term
    placements (1 month +). Free accommodation may be possible for long-term
    volunteers, subject to availability. "
heading: MARDi
description: MARDi is an international network of healthcare professionals
  providing medical aid for refugees and displaced people living in the Paris
  Refugee Camps, France. We provide frontline medical care in the camps and work
  with many other services to deliver all-round support. Since 2015, the number
  of refugees living in unofficial camps in Paris has fluctuated between 1,000
  and 4,000, surviving the harsh French winters in broken tents on food from
  volunteer groups and with very little access to healthcare.
