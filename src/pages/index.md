heading: MARDi
description: MARDi is an international network of healthcare professionals,
  translators and support staff providing frontline front aid and emergency care
  for refugees and displaced people living in the Paris Refugee Camps, France.
  We work directly in the camps and with many other services to deliver
  all-round support for this refugee community. Since 2015, the number of
  refugees living in unofficial camps in Paris has fluctuated between 1,000 and
  4,000, surviving the harsh French winters in broken tents, cold squats and
  makeshift huts on food provided by volunteer groups and with very little
  access to healthcare.
