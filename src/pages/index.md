  title: COVID-19 update (June 2020)
  description: >
    Now that travel restrictions in France are starting to ease, medics are able to travel freely again. MARDi is still providing medical care to those displaced people who are living on the streets of Paris and we need volunteers to join our teams.
heading: MARDi
description: >-
  MARDi is an international network of healthcare professionals providing voluntary medical aid to refugees and displaced people living in refugee camps in Paris, France. We provide first aid, basic medical care and triage in the camps and work with many other services to deliver all-round care.
  Since 2015, the number of refugees living in unofficial camps in Paris has fluctuated between 1,000 and 4,000, surviving in broken tents on food from volunteer groups with very little access to healthcare.

#   heading: Great coffee with no compromises
#   description: >
#     We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
#     That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
#     journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
#     optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
