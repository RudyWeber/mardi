The MARDi clinic provides frontline first aid and emergency care directly in camps, squats and unstable communities with volunteers from across the globe. 

Directly working with other NGOs and established healthcare services we try to meet the vast and varied healthcare needs of these homeless populations. We also coordinate with non-medical aid groups to provide all-encompassing support for people living in these communities.
