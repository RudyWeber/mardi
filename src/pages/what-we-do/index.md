The MARDi clinic provides frontline medical care directly in the camps, with volunteers from across the globe and working with other NGOs and French healthcare services to meet the vast and varied healthcare needs of this refugee population. We also coordinate with the non-medical aid groups in Paris to provide all-encompassing support for people living in these camps. For example, in the regular and ineffective government-led evacuations.

Our work has two main aims; firstly to bridge the healthcare gap between what refugees get and what they deserve, and secondly, to show refugees that Europe is not just a place of racism and hostility, that it has a strong, compassionate side that welcomes refugees and will fight for them. Drinking Afghan green tea around a campfire or Ethiopian coffee with a family in a makeshift hut is as important as dressing wounds and treating headaches.

We also collect evidence of the human rights abuses occurring daily in the camps and present this in as many circles as possible. For example:

* [Our social media platform](/contact-us)
* Articles in international publications, e.g.

  * [The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)32093-8/fulltext)
  * [British Journal of GPs](https://bjgplife.com/2020/02/11/caring-for-refugees-in-europe-can-kindness-overcome-hostility)
* Speaker events with other grassroots organisations, such as:
